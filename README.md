Problem Statement

As an emerging Electric Vehicle (EV) startup, we aim to identify the most viable customer segments and vehicle categories for market entry in India's evolving EV landscape. Given the diverse consumer base, varying income levels, and differing mobility needs, a data-driven segmentation analysis is required to pinpoint the most promising target audience.


Conclusion

This analysis provides deep insights into the Indian EV market, helping businesses segment and target customers effectively.

- Segment 0 and Segment 3 are ideal candidates for premium EVs.
- Segment 1 requires financing schemes and budget-friendly options.
- Segment 2 is price-sensitive and needs incentives or subsidies to encourage EV adoption.

By incorporating advanced machine learning techniques, expanding data collection, and refining segmentation, this startup can develop precise marketing and product strategies to increase EV adoption rates and establish a sustainable presence in the Indian EV industry.
